<d>In the distant future, mankind will go extinct leaving Doggos as the most prosperous creature.</d>
<d>Doggos of all shapes and sizes will possess talents no humans could dream of having today.</d>
<d>A company called DOGGO NEEDS INC. will have a monopoly over almost everything.</d>
<d>At the same time Doggos will live in a most captivating futuristic world.</d>
<d>But one Doggo will almost completely surpass the rest.</d>
<d>And his name will of course be..... Doggo.</d>
<d>Doggo woke up. They'd been staying at the K-9 hotel now for longer than they'd hoped.</d>
<d>Doggo stared out the window at the sun long enough for it to harm his health.</d>
<d>It was a perfect day for a walk.</d>
<d>Doggo dug up his old robot and had it walk it at its pace of choice.</d>
<d>Not long after they'd started, they got hungry.</d>
<d>Fortunately they were only about a block away from their favorite supplier of treats, DOGGO NEEDS INC.</d>
<d>Doggo waltzed into the store exhausted from the walk, and started searching for treats.</d>
<d>On display near the center of the shop was a treat labeled "THE ULTIMATE TASTY TREAT".</d>
<d>Doggo stared at it for awhile. It appeared to glow.</d>
<d>Signs surrounded the display. "Remember citizens of 'DOGGO NEEDS' district; all thieves regardless of crime will be TICKLED TO THEIR DOOM".</d>
<d>Without thinking, Doggo stole the treat. It was odd because up to this point he'd been a model citizen.</d>
<d>He also stole a car parked outside the shop, and soon him and his robot dog were in a high speed chase with a bunch of cops.</d>
